A model that predicts the prices of houses. 

It was trained using the California Housing Prices database on Kaggle. Download the data here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices

We used the Linear Regression Model and Random Forest Model both to estimate the accuracy. It was, however, more accurate using the Random Forest Model, as expected.
